Given N numbers find out a number such that it is divides all the numbers except 1. If it is not possible then print -1.

Input:
The first line consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each case there are 2 lines.
The first line of each test case consists of a number N. The second line contains N numbers.

Output:
For each case output a single integer on a new line denoting the answer to the problem.

Constraints:
T<=50
N<=100000
Ai<=109

Example:
Input:
2
4
2 3 6 12
5
9 8 7 6 5

Output:
3
-1

Explanation:
In the first case the 3 divides all the numbers except 2. So, it is possible answer.
In the second case there are no numbers that can divide all the numbers except for one, so it is -1.
